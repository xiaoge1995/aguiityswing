			<p>When Feng Lu was 13 years old, his father remarryied another woman who was only 8 years older than Feng Lu. Feng Lu didn't hate her. She talked less and never interfere him. She didn't love Feng Lu's father. She just wanted to have someone to rely on. One year later, Feng Lu's younger sister, Qing Qing, was born. <img src="./imgs/story_3.jpg" class="alignLeft">After 2 years, Qing Qing's mother died. Feng Lu lost his mom again. Almost at the same time, his father was put into prison. Feng Lu was 17 years old, struggling with life with his 3-year-old sister.</p>

			

			<p>Fortunately, Feng Lu's neightbor, grandma Song, liked the brother and sister. She always took care of Qing Qing. But she told Feng Lu that Qing Qing behaved badly without him. She ate less and got sick. On one night, Qing Qing suddenly got into her brother's quilt and hug him, crying. Feng Lu was impatient with her and gave her a toy swing. Qing Qing liked the swing and stopped crying. After that night, Qing Qing slept on the same bed with Feng Lu.</p>

Once they bought the tickets to Xiamen for a trip. They couldn't afford the hotel so they came back on the same day. They just went to beach and sat there for a long time.</p>

Qing Qing looked pretty, with big eyes and long hair. But Feng Lu never hug her, unlike other adults did. Feng Lu felt he always resisted this relationship in his deep mind and tended to escape. But he knew he cared about Qing Qing.</p>


			<p>On the day of Qing Qing's birthday, they steal a tire from a garage to make a swing as the birthday present. However, when Qing Qing was playing the swing, two policemen broke in and arrested the brother……</p>
